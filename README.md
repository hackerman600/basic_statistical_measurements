This file shows skill progression over a 1 - 2 day time frame. C makes me appreciate higher level languages like python and c++ more. I would not use it for machine learning or day to day tasks where speed is not a priority. Even if speed was, I am more comfortable using c++ and beleive c++ could be faster anyway.
